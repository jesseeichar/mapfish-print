The purpose of Mapfish Print is to create reports that contain maps (and map related components) within them.
<p>
    The project is a Java based servlet/library/application based on the mature
    <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">Jasper Reports Library</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Mapfish print has the following distributions:
<ul>
    <li>
        The most commonly used distribution is the <em>war</em> distribution where Mapfish Print is a servlet and can be ran in a
        Servlet container like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache Tomcat</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mapfish print is also distributed as a Java <em>jar</em> which allows Mapfish print to be used like a normal Java library, or
        embedded in an existing Java web application as an addition servlet
    </li>
    <li>
        The Java <em>war</em> is also packaged as a debian package
    </li>
    <li>
        The last distribution is an command-line application where the reports can be generated via command line.  This is useful for
        debugging configurations and requests.
    </li>
</ul>
